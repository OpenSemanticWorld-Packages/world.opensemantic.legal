Privacy policy, Data Protection Information, etc.

The main branch of this repo is a template package.
Please create your own fork and replace [/core/Project/Privacy_policy.wikitext](/core/Project/Privacy_policy.wikitext) with a template-call:

```wikitext
{{Helper/Project/Privacy_policy
|contact=<your data protection office>
|email=<your data protection officer email>
}}
```

`contact` is address of the responsible organization.
If no `email` address is provided, reference is made to the postal `contact` address.
